A proposal for structure definition


= Details =

The project structure looks like this:

 * Assets
  * Animations
  * Materials
  * Meshes
  * Scenes
  * Scripts
   * Minerva
  * Shaders

The folder 'Minerva' is where Alejandro stores his scripts, so they don't get messed up when they're testing different scripts and have the same name
