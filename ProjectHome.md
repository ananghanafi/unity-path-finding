We are seeking to test some algorythms for their use in multi-agent pathfinding for shooter games (first or third person) drived by our Intelligent Systems Course in our Computer Science Master. We will implement them in Unity for the sake of simplicity to program the 3D graphics part.

We are using Unity 3D v3.2f4
