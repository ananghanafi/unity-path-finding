# Introduction #

A proposal for structure definition


# Details #

The project structure looks like this:

  * Assets
    * Animations
    * Materials
    * Meshes
    * Scenes
    * Scripts
      * Minerva
    * Shaders
    * Standard Assets
      * Scripts

The folder 'Minerva' is where Alejandro stores his scripts, so they don't get messed up when they're testing different scripts and have the same name

Also there are some Standard Assets Scripts from Unity default project
